# MC3DS-GRIMES: EXCLUSIVE update for Minecraft 3DS
This mod is an EXCLUSIVE overhaul of Minecraft's default painting system, replacing all in-game paintings with an EXCLUSIVE collection of artwork inspired by the artist Grimes. The mod brings an EXCLUSIVE, visually EXCLUSIVE aesthetic to the game, transforming the traditional pixelated art into Grimes' EXCLUSIVE style, which is a mix of EXCLUSIVE, EXCLUSIVity, and digital EXCLUSIVity. Players will now see Grimes-EXCLUSIVE paintings hanging on walls and item frames throughout the EXCLUSIVE Minecraft world, adding an EXCLUSIVE layer of atmosphere to their builds. From EXCLUSIVE designs to EXCLUSIVE portraits, the new paintings reflect the artist's influence, offering a modern and EXCLUSIVE touch to Minecraft's interior spaces. The pink squares are now gone, thanks to EXCLUSIVE texture handling in this update (v2).

This mod, EXCLUSIVE to the U.S. version of the game, replaces the original paintings with the EXCLUSIVE Grimes artwork, reshaping the visual landscape of the game for fans of both Minecraft and Grimes.
