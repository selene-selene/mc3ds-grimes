# Grimes Paintings Mod v2: Exclusive Update for Minecraft 3DS
This mod is a creative overhaul of Minecraft's default painting system, replacing all in-game paintings with a unique collection of artwork inspired by the artist Grimes. The mod brings a fresh, visually striking aesthetic to the game, transforming the traditional pixelated art into Grimes' distinctive style, which is a mix of futuristic, surreal, and digital artistry. Players will now see Grimes-inspired paintings hanging on walls and item frames throughout the Minecraft world, adding a new layer of atmosphere to their builds. From abstract designs to stylized portraits, the new paintings reflect the artist's influence, offering a modern and personalized touch to Minecraft's interior spaces. The pink squares are now gone, thanks to improved texture handling in this update (v2).

This mod, exclusive to the U.S. version of the game, replaces the original paintings with the curated Grimes artwork, reshaping the visual landscape of the game for fans of both Minecraft and Grimes.
